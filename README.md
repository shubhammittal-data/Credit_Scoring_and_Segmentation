## 📌 Introduction
Credit Scoring & Segmentation helps financial institutions assess **customer creditworthiness** by evaluating factors like **credit history, payment behavior, and credit utilization**. This project:
- **Calculates credit scores** using a modified **FICO** scoring methodology.
- **Segments customers** into risk categories using **KMeans clustering**.
- **Visualizes credit behavior** using **interactive plots**.
